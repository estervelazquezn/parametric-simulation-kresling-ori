# Parametric analysis and Optimization of Kresling Origami

This code has been based on the willing to develope a tool for designing and optimization a Kresling origami pattern by structural simualtions based in Abaqus CAE. Simulations has been launched from python scrpting thanks to `abqpy` library https://github.com/haiiliin/abqpy. Whereas optimization has been made using free software Dakota Sandia https://dakota.sandia.gov/ and the surrogate model was developed thanks to `smt` library https://github.com/SMTorg/smt.
